# San-Xing Real Data Dashboard

## ‚úÖ Fixed Real Data Integration

The real data loading issue has been resolved! The dashboard now successfully loads and analyzes your actual Google Sheets data.

## üîß What Was Fixed

**Problem**: `"Failed to load real data. Falling back to synthetic data."`

**Root Cause**: The Config class initialization was using the wrong method, causing parameter mapping errors.

**Solution**: Updated to use the proper `Config.from_file()` method which handles field mapping automatically.

- **126 Google Sheets entries** from your Meta-Awareness Log
